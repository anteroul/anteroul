# Hi there, and thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹
- I'm a software engineer/game developer by trade specialized in Game Engine Developement using Graphics APIs and Multimedia Libraries.
- I have many years of experience using OpenGL, SDL, and other more high-level frameworks for building games. I prefer writing my games in a text editor rather than using a bloated game engine with all its fancy features readily available.
- You can best reach me on LinkedIn.
